# Github landing page
A landing page to display some of the other projects I've built.
Projects may have a live demo link and a demo picture.

Built using react and the github api, this webpage is easy to update. To add a project onto this page, I simply add the project name in selectedRepos in project.js. 
Before build production, I plan on getting the selected repos from a textfile in another repo. This way changes can be made by editing that text file, to avoid rebuilding live react projects.
